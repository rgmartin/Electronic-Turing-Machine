Turing Machine is a mathematical model designed to study the limits of computability. This work discusses the physical principles on which this model is based and its viability. In particular, an implementation of an electronic circuit that simulates a Turing Machine is desrcibed in this work.
This work was submitted to the XXIX Students Scientific Workshop of the Faculty of Physics of the University of Havana, held on May 16 and 17, 2013.
